## About Project

Inspiration üí° In today's fast-paced digital world, small businesses and brands rely heavily on social media to promote their products and engage with customers. But here's the catch: many of these businesses can't afford to hire professional marketers. That's where OnPoint comes in! We wanted to create a super cool AI-enabled marketing creator tool specifically designed for small businesses. OnPoint is like having your own social media team, making it easy for you to run and maintain your social media accounts.

What it does üöÄ OnPoint is the ultimate social media sidekick for small businesses. 

We used cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms for content generation and analysis. Our AI models are trained to understand your brand's voice and style, delivering top-notch content every time. Our generative AI models are the secret sauce behind the custom promotional material. They can adapt to your color preferences and style choices, making your brand shine.

## Built With

This project was developed with the following technologies:

#### **Frontend** 
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  - [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
  - [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

#### **Backend** <sub><sup>Express</sup></sub>
   - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)

## Development Challenges

Designing AI models that can generate diverse and eye-catching promotional material was no small task. We wanted to make sure your content stands out from the crowd. Integrating the backend AI algorithms seamlessly with the frontend interface was also EXTREMELY HARD. We wanted the user experience to be as smooth as possible. We wanted to keep things simple and stress-free for the user. But making all of this in 2 days was madness.

_\* The integration of all things together was the major part we wanted to make sure that it is easy to contribute._
